# Stock Time Series Dynamic

In this activity, we expand on our previous time series plot with a dynamic plot that reads the stock from the user form.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided and complete the function `handleSubmit`

* Add an event listener to the submit button that will take the input value and search quandl for a particular stock.

## Hints

* To select the input value from the form, select the input element containing the user's desired stock; use the [node](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_node) function on your selection; and use dot notation to retrieve the [value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) attribute from the result.

* To clear the input value, set the above `value` equal to the empty string.
