# Stock Time Series HTML Report

In this activity, we will complete our financial time series project by building an HTML report page for our visualizations.

## Instructions

* Use Bootstrap to build a financial report HTML page.

  * This page should include the following:

    1. A Plotly time series plot of the stock.

    2. A Table of the 12 month stock data

    3. A company summary panel

* Complete the missing code in `plots.js` to dynamically build a table of the monthly stock data using `Plotly.d3`.
