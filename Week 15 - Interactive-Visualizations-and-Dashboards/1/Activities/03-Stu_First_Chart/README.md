# A Flicker of the Eye

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will create your first Plotly bar chart.

* Use the information in `eye_flicker.csv` for this activity. In the script file, create an array called `eyeColor` that replicates the `Colour` column in the CSV file: `var eyeColor = ["Brown", "Brown", etc.]`

* Do the same for the `Flicker` column: `var eyeFlicker = [26.8, 27.9, etc]`.

* Use Plotly to create a bar chart of eye color vs the frequency of eye flickers.

* What happens? What is Plotly doing?

## Bonus

* How would you make this plot more meaningful? Try to create a more meaningful plot.
