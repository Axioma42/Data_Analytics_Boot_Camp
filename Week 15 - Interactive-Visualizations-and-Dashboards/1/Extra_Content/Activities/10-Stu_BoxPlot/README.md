# Cancer Survival

In this activity, you will create a box plot of cancer survival rates for patients treated with ascorbate. The purpose of this study was to determine if the survival times differ with respect to the organ affected by the cancer.

Note: This study found that the square root transformation appears to make the residuals more symmetric, so use the square root of survival as the dependent variable.

## Instructions

* Create a box plot for each of the organ types.

* Calculate the square root of the survival as the depended variable.

  * Use `map` to apply the square root.

## BONUS

* Plot all of the data points next to each box plot using attributes available in the plotly documentation for [box plots](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#box-boxpoints)
