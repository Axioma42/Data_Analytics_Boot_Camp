# Bigfoot Afoot

In this activity, you will create a full-stack application comprising a database, server, and front end.

## Instructions

* For the server side (Python) of the application, use pandas to create a DataFrame with `year` and `sightings` columns from the results of the database query at the `/data` endpoint.

* Return a jsonified dictionary to the client.

* For the client side (JavaScript) of the application, create a plot from the data returned after making a request to the `/data` API endpoint.
