# Never Gonna Give You Up

## Instructions

### Server-side (Python)

* Complete the `pie` API route in `app.py` so that it returns the data needed to render a Plotly chart client-side.

### Client-side (JavaScript)

* In `index.html`, use `d3.json()` to make a request at the `pie` endpoint. Then, create a `Plotly` pie chart with the data returned by the server.

## BONUS

* Study the code in `lyrics.py` to understand how it works.

* Explain it to your neighbor.
